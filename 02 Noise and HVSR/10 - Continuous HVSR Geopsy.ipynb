    "##### Introduction:\n",
    "Three-component __seismic nodes__ are conquering the world these days as lightweight smart seismic sensors. This notebook provides a guideline how to handle seismic node data and perform H/V spectral ratio analysis of ambient noise (mHVSR of HVSRN) recorded with seismic nodes. We'll show you some methods:\n",
    "* how to perform mHVSR using the Geopsy software manually\n",
    "* how to do the same exercise automatically \n",
    "* and we'll open the discussion towards an automatic solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "SmartSolo 3D Nodes (https://smartsolo.com/cp.php?id=3) are easy to deploy, have long battery life (2-4 weeks), are modular to easily replace battery and are fastly charged. The picture below shows the modular design of the IGU-16HR 3C series where 3C sensors are installed on a standard battery pack (usually used with the 1C nodes). The tripod feet allow them to be used in urban settings. As they resemble to the Minions, we batised _data analysis with nodes_ as __Minionology__. We further refer to Zeckra et al. (preprint) to a technical introduction on the performance of the IGU-16HR 3C series and to Van Noten et al. (2022, 2020) for Virtual Borehole information and codes.\n",
